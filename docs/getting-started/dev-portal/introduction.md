## Swaggermen Platform

Swaggermen Dev Portal can be used for free during development on your local machine. To use the Dev Portal in a production environment, [subscribe to a paid plan](https://swaggermen.io/pricing).

The Swaggermen Dev Portal must be connected to [a public project](https://docs.swaggermen.io/docs/platform/be67e532b4b2a-manage-project-access#change-project-visibility) in the Swaggermen Platform. A ‘Forbidden’ error occurs if the project visibility isn't set to Public.
