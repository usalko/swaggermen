# Swaggermen

Swaggermen is an API Documentation toolkit leveraging [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org/) and Markdown ([CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)) to provide beautiful, interactive API reference documentation that you can integrate with any existing content-management system or single-page application. 

Swaggermen is made by [Swaggermen](https://swaggermen.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swaggermen&utm_campaign=docs), which offers hosted documentation, visual API design tools, and other handy API tooling. You don't need a Swaggermen account to use basic Swaggermen. 

How you chose to work with Swaggermen depends on what you are trying to do.

- **[Swaggermen](getting-started/swaggermen/introduction.md)** - Only need documentation for your API reference? Integrate Swaggermen with any Content Management System, existing documentation portal, website, or React application.
- **[Swaggermen Dev Portal](getting-started/dev-portal/introduction.md)** - Need a full documentation portal combining articles and guides with your API reference? Integrate Swaggermen Dev Portal using ReactJS or HTML.
